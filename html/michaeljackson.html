            Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American singer,
             songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is widely regarded as one
              of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest 
              entertainers of all time. He was also known for his unorthodox lifestyle, residing in 
              a private amusement park he called Neverland Ranch, and often becoming the focus of tabloid 
              scrutiny. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized 
              personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.

            The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with 
            his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began 
            his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and in the early 1980s, became a dominant 
            figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "
            " from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming.
