                Steven Siro Vai (/vaÉª/; born June 6, 1960) is an American guitarist, composer, singer, songwriter, 
                and producer. A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee,[1] Vai started his music 
                career in 1978 at the age of eighteen as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa,[2] and joined his band 
                from 1980 to 1983.[1] He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released eight solo albums to date.[3]
                 He has recorded and toured with Alcatrazz,
                <br><br>
                David Lee Roth, and Whitesnake, as well as recording with artists such as Mary J. Blige, Spinal Tap, and 
                Ozzy Osbourne. Additionally, Vai has toured with live-only acts G3, Zappa Plays Zappa, and the Experience 
                Hendrix tour, as well as headlining international tours.[4]

                Vai has been described as a "highly individualistic player" and part of a generation of "heavy rock and metal 
                virtuosi who came to the fore in the 1980s".[5] He released his first solo album Flex-Able in 1984, while his most 
                successful release, Passion and Warfare (1990), was described as "the richest and best hard rock guitar-virtuoso album 
                of the '80s".[6] He was voted the "10th Greatest Guitarist" by Guitar World magazine,[7] and has sold over 15 million
                 records.[1][8]
