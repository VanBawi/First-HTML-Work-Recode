           <strong> Guitar, plucked stringed musical instrument </strong>that 
           probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving 
           from the guitarra latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted 
           body and four strings. 
            he early guitar was narrower and deeper than the modern guitar, 
            with a less pronounced waist. It was closely related to the vihuela, 
            the guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute.

            The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, 
            the top course single, that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension 
            bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly; the bridge thus sustained the 
            direct pull of the strings. 
            
            <br><br>
        <p>
            From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument. 
            A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a 
            sixth course was added. Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single 
            strings tuned E–A–D–G–B–E′, still the standard tuning.
            In the belly was a circular sound hole, often ornamented with a 
            carved wooden rose. The 16th-century guitar was tuned C–F–A–D′, the tuning 
            of the centre four courses of the lute and of the vihuela.

            The violin-type pegbox was replaced about 1600 by a flat, slightly reflexed head 
            with rear tuning pegs; in the 19th century, metal screws were substituted for the
             tuning pegs. 
            The early tied-on gut frets were replaced by built-on ivory or metal frets in the 
            18th century. The fingerboard was originally flush with and ended at the belly, and 
            several metal or ivory frets were placed directly on the belly. In the 19th century
             the fingerboard was raised slightly above the level of the belly and was extended 
             across it to the edge of the sound hole.
