            <stroong>A list song, also called a laundry </stroong>list song or a catalog song, is a song based wholly or in part on a 
            list.[1]:xiii[2][3][4][5][6] Unlike topical songs with a narrative and a cast of characters, 
            list songs typically develop by working through a series of information, often humorous or comically, articulating 
            their images additively, and sometimes use items of escalating absurdity.[7][8]

            The form as a defining feature of an oral tradition dates back to early classical antiquity,[9][10] 
            where it played an important part of early hexameter poetry for oral bards like Homer and Hesiod.[11][12]
            
            In classical opera the list song has its own genre, the catalogue aria, that was especially popular
             in Italian opera buffa and comic opera in the latter half of the eighteenth and early nineteenth 
             centuries. Leporello's aria "Madamina, il catalogo è questo" (lit. "Little lady, this is the catalogue"), 
             also nicknamed The Catalogue Aria,[13][14] is a prominent example, and often mentioned as a direct antecedent t
             o the 20th-century musical's list song.[15][16][17][18]
     <p>       
            <strong>The list song is a frequent element </strong>of 20th-century popular music and became a Broadway staple.[19]
             Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Noël Coward, and Stephen Sondheim are composers and lyricists who have 
             used the form.[20][21] The very first commercial recording of a Cole Porter tune was his list song 
             "I've a Shooting Box in Scotland" originally from See America First (1913).[22][23] Berlin followed 
             soon after with the list song "When I Discovered You" from his first complete Broadway score Watch Your Step (1914).[24]
     </p>      
            <em>Porter would frequently return </em>to the list song form, notable examples include "You're the Top" from 
            the 1934 musical Anything Goes,[25][26][27] "Friendship", one of Porter's wittiest list songs, from 
            DuBarry Was a Lady,[28]:483 and "Farming" and "Let's Not Talk About Love" both from Let's Face It! (1942), 
            and both written for Danny Kaye to showcase his ability with tongue-twisting lyrics.[29] In "You're the Top" 
            Porter pays tribute to his colleague Irving Berlin by including the item "You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad."[30][31][32]
    <p>         
            Irving Berlin would likewise often write songs in the genre, notable examples include "My Beautiful 
            Rhinestone Girl" from Face the Music (1932), a list song that starts of with a sequence of negative similes,[33] 
            "Outside of That I Love You" from Louisiana Purchase[34], and "Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)" a challenge-duet,
             and Berlin's starkest antithesis-driven list song,[35] "You Can't Get a Man with a Gun",[36] and "Doin' What Comes Natur'lly",
             [37] all three from the 1946 musical Annie Get Your Gun.
