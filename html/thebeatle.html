            The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. 
            The line-up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo 
            Starr led the band to be regarded as the foremost and most influential
             in history.[1] With a sound rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and 
             roll, the group were integral to the evolution of pop music into an art 
             form, and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.[2]
